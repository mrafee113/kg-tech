* You can constrain a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) so that it is restricted to run on particular [node(s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/), or to prefer to run on particular nodes. There are several ways to do this and the recommended approaches all use [label selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to facilitate the selection. Often, you do not need to set any such constraints; the [scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/) will automatically do a reasonable placement (for example, spreading your Pods across nodes so as not place Pods on a node with insufficient free resources). However, there are some circumstances where you may want to control which node the Pod deploys to, for example, to ensure that a Pod ends up on a node with an SSD attached to it, or to co-locate Pods from two different services that communicate a lot into the same availability zone.
* You can use any of the following methods to choose where Kubernetes schedules specific Pods:
	* [nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) field matching against [node labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#built-in-node-labels)
	* [Affinity and anti-affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
	* [nodeName](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodename) field
	* [Pod topology spread constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#pod-topology-spread-constraints)
