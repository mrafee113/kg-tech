* When you specify a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), you can optionally specify how much of each resource a [container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) needs. The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory (RAM); there are others.
* When you specify the resource request for containers in a Pod, the [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/) uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on. When you specify a resource limit for a container, the [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubelet) enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set. The kubelet also reserves at least the request amount of that system resource specifically for that container to use.
