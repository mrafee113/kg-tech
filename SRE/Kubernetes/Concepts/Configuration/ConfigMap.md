* A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a [volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).
* A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your [container images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-image), so that your applications are easily portable.

> [!Caution]
> ConfigMap does not provide secrecy or encryption. If the data you want to store are confidential, use a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) rather than a ConfigMap, or use additional (third party) tools to keep your data private.
