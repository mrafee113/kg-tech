* On-disk files in a container are ephemeral, which presents some problems for non-trivial applications when running in containers. One problem occurs when a container crashes or is stopped. Container state is not saved so all of the files that were created or modified during the lifetime of the container are lost. During a crash, kubelet restarts the container with a clean state. Another problem occurs when multiple containers are running in a Pod and need to share files. It can be challenging to setup and access a shared filesystem across all of the containers. The Kubernetes [volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) abstraction solves both of these problems.

### Background
* Kubernetes supports many types of volumes. A [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) can use any number of volume types simultaneously. [Ephemeral volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/) types have a lifetime of a pod, but [persistent volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) exist beyond the lifetime of a pod. When a pod ceases to exist, Kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes; however, Kubernetes does not destroy persistent volumes. For any kind of volume in a given pod, data is preserved across container restarts.
* At its core, a volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the containers in a pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.

> [!Question] ChatGPT
> Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a specification that defines a standard interface between container orchestrators like Kubernetes and storage providers. It allows storage vendors to develop their own plugins that can be used with container orchestration systems without having to modify the core code of those systems.
> 
> Here's an explanation of Kubernetes CSI:
> 
> 1. **Introduction to CSI:**
> 	  - **Container Orchestrators:** Container orchestrators like Kubernetes manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.
> 	  - **Storage in Containers:** Containers often require persistent storage for data that survives beyond the lifetime of a container.
> 
> 2. **The Need for CSI:**
> 	  - Before CSI, storage in Kubernetes was closely integrated with the core code.
> 	  - This integration made it challenging to add or update storage features without modifying the core Kubernetes codebase.
> 
> 3. **CSI as a Solution:**
> 	  - CSI provides a standard interface between container orchestrators and storage systems.
> 	  - With CSI, storage vendors can create their own plugins that adhere to the CSI specification.
> 
> 4. **Key Components of CSI:**
> 	  - **CSI Driver:** This is the storage driver provided by the storage vendor. It interacts with the storage system and implements the CSI interface.
> 	  - **CSI Plugin:** The plugin is responsible for communicating with the CSI driver and translating CSI calls to actions that the storage system understands.
> 	  - **CSI Sidecar Container:** In a pod, the CSI sidecar container is responsible for handling volume-related operations. It communicates with the CSI plugin and manages the lifecycle of volumes.
> 
> 5. **How CSI Works in Kubernetes:**
> 	  - A Kubernetes user specifies a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in their application manifest, indicating the need for persistent storage.
> 	  - The CSI driver translates this claim into actions that the storage system understands, such as creating a volume.
> 	  - The CSI plugin communicates with the CSI driver and interacts with the storage system to perform the required operations.
> 	  - The CSI sidecar container in the pod manages the volume lifecycle and interacts with the CSI plugin for operations like mounting the volume into the container.
> 
> 6. **Advantages of CSI:**
> 	  - **Modularity:** CSI allows storage and container orchestration to evolve independently.
> 	  - **Ecosystem Support:** Many storage providers can create CSI drivers, leading to a diverse ecosystem of storage solutions for Kubernetes.
> 
> 7. **Use Cases:**
> 	  - CSI is beneficial in scenarios where organizations need to use specific storage solutions that may not be natively supported by Kubernetes.
> 
> In summary, Kubernetes CSI provides a standardized way for storage systems to integrate with container orchestrators, enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of persistent storage in containerized environments.
