* Each container that you run is repeatable; the standardization from having dependencies included means that you get the same behavior wherever you run it.
* Containers decouple applications from the underlying host infrastructure. This makes deployment easier in different cloud or OS environments.
* Each [node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in a Kubernetes cluster runs the containers that form the [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) assigned to that node. Containers in a Pod are co-located and co-scheduled to run on the same node.

### Container images
* A [container image](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/) is a ready-to-run software package containing everything needed to run an application: the code and any runtime it requires, application and system libraries, and default values for any essential settings.
* Containers are intended to be stateless and [immutable](https://glossary.cncf.io/immutable-infrastructure/): you should not change the code of a container that is already running. If you have a containerized application and want to make changes, the correct process is to build a new image that includes the change, then recreate the container to start from the updated image.

### Container runtimes
* A fundamental component that empowers Kubernetes to run containers effectively. It is responsible for managing the execution and lifecycle of containers within the Kubernetes environment.
* Kubernetes supports container runtimes such as [containerd](https://containerd.io/docs/), [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/#what-is-cri-o), and any other implementation of the [Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/container-runtime-interface.md).
* Usually, you can allow your cluster to pick the default container runtime for a Pod. If you need to use more than one container runtime in your cluster, you can specify the [RuntimeClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/) for a Pod to make sure that Kubernetes runs those containers using a particular container runtime.
* You can also use RuntimeClass to run different Pods with the same container runtime but with different settings.
