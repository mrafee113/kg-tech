9.
	p= the system is in multiuser state

	3. the kernel is not functioning or the system is in interrupt mode.

	4. if the system is not in multiuser state, then it is in interrupt mode.
		~p -> s
	5. the system is not in interrupt mode.

	5 => s=false

	p= the router can send packets to the edge system
	q= the router supoorts the new address space
	r= the latest software release is installed
	1. the router can send packets to the edge system only if it supports the new address space
		p -> q
	2. for the router to support the new address space it is necessary that the latest software release be installed
		q -> r
	3. the router can send packets to the edge system if the latest software release is installed
		r -> p
	4. the router does not support the new address space

19. :VERY HARD:
21. :INTERESTING:

Exercises 23-27 relate to inhabitants of the island of knights and knaves,
	where knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. You
	encounter two people, A and B. Determine, if possible, what A and B are
	if they address you in the ways described. If you cannot determine what
	these two people are, can you draw any conclusions?

23. :IMPORTANT: Note how the negation of "at least of us is a knave" is evaluated
25.
	A: i am a knave or b is a knight
	p= a is a knight
	q= b is a knight
	p & (~p | q) = p & q
	~p & ~(~p | q) = ~p & p & ~q => contradiction
	so A is a knight and B is a knight

27.
	A: we are both knaves
	p= a is a knight
	q= b is a knight
	p & ~p & ~q => contradiction => ~p=true => p=false
	~p & ~(p & q) = ~p & (~p | q) = ~p | (~p & ~q) => q=true

Exercies 28-35 relate to inhabitants of an island on which there are
	three kinds of people: knights who always tell the truth, knaves
	who always lie, an spies who can either lie or tell the truth.
	you encounter three people, A, B, and C. you know one of these
	people is a knight, one is a knave, and one is a spy. each of the
	three people knows the type of person each of other two is. for
	each of these situations, if possible, determine whether there
	is a unique solution and determine who the knave, knight, and
	spy are. when there is no unique solution, list all possible
	solutions or state that there are no solutions.

29.
	A: i am the knight
	B: i am the knave
	C: b is the knight
	- neither the knight nor the knave would say they are the knave.
	B is a spy => C is the knave => A is the knight

31.
	A: i am the knight
	B: a is telling the truth
	C: i am the spy
	C is either a spy and telling the truth or a knave.
	if B is telling the truth, B is a spy.
	if B is lying, B is a spy or a knave. so A is a spy or a knave.
	C is not a knight. B is not the knight. so A is the knight.
	so B was telling the truth, and is a spy.
	then C is a knave.

33.
	A: i am the knight
	B: i am the knight
	C: i am the knight
	- A is the knight, B is the spy, and C is the knave.
	- A is the knight, B is the knave and C is the spy.
	- B is the knight, A is the spy, and C is the knave.
	- B is the knight, A is the knave, and C is the spy.
	- C is the knight, A is the spy, and B is the knave.
	- C is the knight, A is the knave, and C is the spy.

35.
	A: i am not the spy
	B: i am not the spy
	C: i am not the spy
	the knave always lies, so telling "i am not the spy" would be a contradiction,
		for which there are no solutions.

Exercises 36-42 are puzzles that can be solved by translating statements
	into logical expressions and reasoning from these expressions using truth tables.

37. :IMPORTANT:
39.
	p= the butler is telling the truth
	q= the cook is telling the truth
	r= the gardener is telling the truth
	s= the handyman is telling the truth
	- if the butler is telling the truth, so is the cook
	- the cook and the gardener cannot both be telling the truth
	- the gardener and the handyman are not both lying
	- if the handyman is telling the truth, then the cook is lying
	presume p=true => q=true => r=false => s=false => contradiction => p=false
	presume s=true => q=false => p=false ->> nothing about s
	presume q=true & p=false => r=false => s=true

	finally: ~p & q & ~r & s

41. :MUCH SIMPLER THAN I THOUGHT:
	sign 1: in this room there is a lady, and in the other one a tiger
	sign 2: in one of these rooms, there is a lady, and in one of them there is a tiger
	r= sign 1 is telling the truth= p & ~q
	s= sign 2 is telling the truth= (p & ~q) | (~p & q)
	p= room one has a lady, not a tiger
	q= room two has a lady, not a tiger
	presume r=true => s=false => (p & ~q) = false => contradiction => ~r & s

43. given any set of 2 senatros, at least one of them is corrupt
		=> there are no sets of 2 senators with both of them being honest
		=> there's only one honest senator

45. a) ~p | (~q & r)
	b) (~p & ~q) | (p & r)
