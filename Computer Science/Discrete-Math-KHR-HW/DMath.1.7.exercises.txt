	theorem: the sum of two odd integers is even.
	Let's assume the hypothesis is true, which means that having two
		integers a and b, they are odd. By the definition of an odd
		integer we have a = 2k + 1 and b = 2t + 1, where k and t
		are integers.
	We want to show that a + b is even. Let's write it down.
		a + b = 2k + 1 + 2t + 1 = 2(k + t + 1)
		Since k and t are integers, and a + b is of the form 2i,
		we conclude that this is true.

3.
	We want to prove the theorem that states "the square of an even number
		is an even number".
	Let's go ahead and presume the hypothesis is true, which means
		having numbers a and k: a = 2k
	We want to show that a**2 is also even. Taking squares from both
		sides of the equation we'll have a**2 = 4k**2, which can be
		expressed as a**2 = 2(2k**2). Since this complies with the
		definition of even numbers, we can conclude that a**2 is even.
	
	> note: I should've presumed the numbers to be integers.

5.
	theorem: if m + n and n + p are even integers, where m, n, and p
		are integers, then m + p is even.
	
	direct poof:
		let's go ahead and presume that the hypothesis is true.
			that means m + n and n + p are even integers.
			therefore having k and t as integers we can have:
			m + n = 2k, n + p = 2t
		We want to show that m + p is even. By summing the two equations
			we have: m + n = 2k + 2t - 2n = 2(k + t + n)
		Since m + n is that of the form of an even integer, we conclude
			that the theorem is true.

	theorem: if x is irrational, then 1/x is irrational
	contrapositive:
		p="x is irrational"
		q="1/x is irrational"
		~p="x is rational"
		~q="1/x is rational"
	we want to prove ~q -> ~p
	direct proof:
		having a and b as integers, b != 0: 1/x = a/b
		we invert both sides presuming a != 0: x = b/a
		except for values 0, we have shown that x is rational.
		which means that the ~q -> ~p is true. which means that
		the original statement that p -> q is true.

15.
	theorem: if x is irrational and x > 0, then sqrt(x) is also irrational.
	contrapositive:
		p="x is irrational"
		q="sqrt(x) is irrational"
		~p="x is rational"
		~q="sqrt(x) is rational"
	direct proof:
		assumming the hypothesis is true, having a and b as integers and b!=0,
			we can have: sqrt(x) = a/b
		Let's take a square off both sides: x = a**2/b**2
		Since x can be written as the division of two integers, we conclude that 
		x is rational.
		Since we've proven ~q -> ~p is true, therefore we conclude that p -> q is
		true as well.

17.
	theorem: p -> q
		p="x + y >= 2"
		q="x >= 1, y >= 1"
	contraposition:
		~p="x + y < 2"
		~q="x < 1, y < 1"
	direct:
		assumming the hypothesis is true, adding the two unequalities
		together: x + y < 2
		since we proved ~q -> ~p is true, we can conclude that p -> q is
		true as well.

19.
	theorem:
		p="n**3 + 5 is odd"
		q="n is even"
	a) contraposition
		~p="n**3 + 5 is even"
		~q="n is odd"
	direct:
		assumming the hypothesis is true, we have: n = 2k + 1
		taking a cube from both sides of the equation we have:
			n**3 = (2k + 1)**3 = (2k + 1)(4k**2 + 4k + 1) \
			= 8k**3 + 12k**2 + 6k + 1
		by adding 5 to each side we have:
			n**3 + 5 = 8k**3 + 12k**2 + 6k + 6 = 2(4k**3 + 6k**2 + 3k + 3)
		since this is even, we have proven ~q -> ~p to be
		true, therefore p -> q is true.
	b) contradiction:
		negation: p & ~q = "n**3 + 5 is odd" and "n is odd"
		presumming ~q to be true:
			n = 2k + 1
			n**3 + 5 = 2(4k**3 + 6k**2 + 3k + 3)
			contradiction => ~q false => q is true

	theorem:
		P(n) = "if n is a positive integer greater than 1, then n**2 > n"
		P(0) = "if 0 is a positive integer greater than 1, then 0**2 > 0"
	since the hypothesis is false, the conditional statement is automatically true.
	vacuous proof

23.
	P(n) = "if a and b are positive real numbers, then (a + b)**n >= a**n + b**n"
	theorem:
		P(1) = "if a and b are positive real numbers, then (a + b) >= a + b"
	this is trivial.

25.
	theorem: at least ten of any 64 days chosen must fall on the
		same day of the week
	contradiction: if there are 9 days or less in the same day of the week,
		it would account for at most 63 days.

27. :too algebraic:
29.
	theorem: if n is a positive integer, then n is odd
		if and only if 5n + 6 is odd.
	direct proof:
		assumming the hypothesis is true, we have n = 2k + 1.
		multiplying both side by 5 and adding 6:
			5n + 6 = 10k + 5 + 6 = 10k + 10 + 1 = 2(5k + 5) + 1
		since we've shown that 5n + 6 is by definition an odd number,
		the theorem is proven.

31.
	theorem: if mn = 1, then m = 1 and n = 1, or else m = -1 and n = -1
	direct:
		assumming mn = 1.
			if we assume that m, as an integer is 1, then 1 * n = 1
				which means that n = 1
			and if we assume that m, as an integer is -1, then -1 * n = 1
				which means that n = -1

33. :creative:
	the author tried a few values of x and figured that x is even,
	then tried to prove the other statments using "x is even".

35. by contraposition...
37.
	x + 3 > 0 => x > -3
	x - 3 > 0 => x > 3
	=> -3 < x < 3
