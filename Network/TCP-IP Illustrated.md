* NAT is essentially a mechanism for allowing the same sets of IP addresses to be reused in different parts of the Internet.
* NAT was introduced to solve two problems: address depletion and concerns regarding the scalability of routing.
* Routing scalability was being tackled with the development of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR; see Chapter 2).
* NAT is popular because it reduces the need for globally routable Internet addresses but also because it offers some degree of natural firewall capability and requires little configuration.
* Despite its popularity, NAT has several drawbacks.
	* The most obvious is that offering Internet-accessible services from the private side of a NAT requires special configuration because privately addressed systems are not directly reachable from the Internet.
	* In addition, for a NAT to work properly, every packet in both directions of a connection or association must pass through the same NAT. This is because the NAT must actively rewrite the addressing information in each packet in order for communication between a privately addressed system and a conventionally addressed Internet host to work.
* NAT poses problems for some application protocols, especially those that send IP addressing information inside the application-layer payload. FTP and SIP are among the best-known protocols of this type. They require a special application-layer gateway function that rewrites the application content in order to work unmodified with NAT or other NAT traversal methods that allow the applications to determine how to work with the specific NAT they are using. A more complete list of considerations regarding NAT appears in. Despite their numerous problems, NATs are very widely used, and most network routers (including essentially all low-end home routers) support it. Today, NATs are so prevalent that application designers are encouraged to make their applications “NAT-friendly”. It is worth mentioning that despite its shortcomings, NAT supports the basic protocols (e.g., e-mail, Web browsing) that are needed by millions of client systems accessing the Internet every day.
* A NAT works by rewriting the identifying information in packets transiting through a router. Most commonly this happens for two directions of a data transfer. In its most basic form, NAT involves rewriting the source IP address of packets as they are forwarded in one direction and the destination IP addresses of packets traveling in the reverse direction. This allows the source IP address in outgoing packets to become one of the NAT router’s Internet-facing interfaces instead of the originating host’s. Thus, to a host on the Internet, packets coming from any of the hosts on the privately addressed side of the NAT appear to be coming from a globally routable IP address of the NAT router.
* The so-called traditional NAT includes both basic NAT and Network Address Port Translation (NAPT).
	* Basic NAT performs rewriting of IP addresses only. In essence, a private address is rewritten to be a public address, often from a pool or range of public addresses supplied by an ISP. This type of NAT is not the most popular because it does not help to dramatically reduce the need for IP addresses—the number of globally routable addresses must equal or exceed the number of internal hosts that wish to access the Internet simultaneously.
	* A much more popular approach, NAPT involves using the transport-layer identifiers (i.e., ports for TCP and UDP, query identifiers for ICMP) to differentiate which host on the private side of the NAT is associated with a particular packet. This allows a large number of internal hosts (i.e., multiple thousands) to access the Internet simultaneously using a limited number of public addresses, often only a single one. We shall ordinarily use the term NAT to include both traditional NAT and NAPT unless the distinction is important in a particular context.
* The addresses used in a private addressing realm “behind” or “inside” a NAT are not enforced by anyone other than the local network administrator. Thus, it is possible for a private realm to make use of global address space. In principle, this is acceptable. However, when such global addresses are owned and being used by another entity on the Internet, local systems in the private realm would most likely be unable to reach the public systems using the same addresses because the close proximity of the local systems would effectively “mask” the visibility of the farther-away systems using the same addresses. To avoid this undesirable situation, there are three IPv4 address ranges reserved for use with private addressing realms: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. These address ranges are often used as default values for address pools in embedded DHCP servers.
* NAT and TCP (page 306): in addition to forwarding the packet, the NAT creates a internal state to remember the fact that a new connection is being handled by the NAT (called a NAT session). At a minimum, this state includes an entry (called a NAT mapping) containing the source IP address and source port of the client.
* in general, fragments cannot be handled properly by simple NATs or NAPTs.
* 7.3.2 Address and Port Translation Behavior: (page 311) Figure 7-5 and table 7-1 are very important.
* 7.3.3 Filtering Behavior (page 313)

###### 11.5.6 Resource Record Types
>> `pg: 28`
>> `time req: 1' 16"`
>> `time done: 45"`

* Although DNS is most commonly used to determine the IP address(es) that correspond to a particular name, it can also be used for the opposite purpose and for a number of other things. It can be used with both IPv4 and IPv6 and can even provide a distributed database function for other than Internet data (other classes,528 Name Resolution and the Domain Name System (DNS) in DNS terminology). The wide range of capabilities provided by DNS is largely attributable to its ability to have different types of resource records.
* There are many types of resource records, and a single name may have multiple matching RRs. Table 11-3 (lookup `dns-record-types-table`) provides a listing of the most common RR types used with conventional DNS (i.e., DNS without the DNSSEC security extensions).
* Resource records are used for many purposes but can be divided into three broad categories:
	* data types
		* they are used to convey information stored in the DNS such as IP addresses and the names of authoritative name servers.
		* The most common data-type RRs include A, NS, SOA, MX, CNAME, PTR, TXT, AAAA, SRV, and NAPTR.
			* The NS records are used to relate the DNS name space to the servers that perform resolution, and they contain the names of authoritative name servers for a zone.
			* The A and AAAA records are used to provide an IPv4 or IPv6 address, respectively, given a particular name.
			* The CNAME record provides a way to have an alias for another domain name.
			* SRV and NAPTR records help applications to discover the location of servers supporting particular services, and to use alternative naming schemes (beyond DNS) to access such services.
	* query types: they use the same values as data types, with a few additional values (e.g., AXFR, IXFR, and \*).
	* meta types: they designate transient data associated with a particular single DNS message. The OPT RR is the only meta type we discuss in this chapter (all others are covered in Chapter 18).

> dns-record-types-table

| Value | RR Type | Description and Purpose |
| :- | :-: | :- |
| 1 | A | Address record for IPv4 (32-bit IPv4 address) |
| 2 | NS | Name server; provides name of authoritative name server for zone |
| 5 | CNAME | Canonical name; maps one name to another (to provide a form of name aliasing) |
| 6 | SOA | Start of authority; provides authoritative information for the zone (name servers, e-mail address of contact, serial number, zone transfer timers) |
| 12 | PTR | Pointer; provides address to (canonical) name mapping; used with `in-addr.arpa` and `ip6.arpa` domains for IPv4 and IPv6 reverse queries |
| 15 | MX | Mail exchanger; provides name of e-mail handling host for a domain |
| 16 | TXT | Text; provides a variety of information (e.g., used with SPF anti-spam scheme to identify authorized e-mail servers) |
| 28 | AAAA | Address record for IPv6 (128-bit IPv6 address) |
| 33 | SRV | Server selection; transport endpoints of a generic service |
| 35 | NAPTR | Name authority pointer; supports alternative name spaces |
| 41 | OPT | Pseudo-RR; supports larger datagrams, labels, return codes in EDNS0 |
| 251 | IXFR | Incremental zone transfer |
| 252 | AXFR | Full zone transfer; carried over TCP |
| 255 | (ANY) | Request for all (any) records |

###### 11.5.6.1 Address (A, AAAA) and Name Server (NS) Records
>>> `pg: 1`
>>> `time req: 3"`
>>> `time done: 11"`
>>> `performance: 27%`

* Arguably the most important records within DNS are these.
* The **A** record contains 32-bit IPv4 addresses.
* AAAA (called "quad-A") records contain IPv6 addresses.
* An NS record contains the name of an authoritative DNS server that contains information for a particular zone.
* Because the name of a DNS server alone is not sufficient to perform a query, the IP address(es) of these servers is also typically provided as a so-called glue record in the additional information section of DNS responses. Indeed, such glue records are required to avoid loops whenever the names of the authoritative name servers use the same domain name for which they are authoritative.

* One subtle point to consider is what data is returned and in what order in response to a DNS query. A DNS server could return all matching data to any client in whatever order the server finds most convenient. However, special configuration options and behaviors are available in most DNS server software to achieve cer- tain operational, privacy, or performance goals.
